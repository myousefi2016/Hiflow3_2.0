To install HiFlow your system must comply with the following requirements:

- Compiler:
  e.g. sudo apt-get install build-essential

- CMake compile system:
  You should use the latest version, download from
  http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

- Boost library version:
  e.g. sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
  For correct compilation and execution of your own programs, you need to include the 
  contrib/boost_libraries/boost and contrib/boost_libraries/boost/tr1 directories 
  explicitly during compilation.

- MPI implementation:
  You need an MPI implementation even for sequential work.
  e.g. sudo apt-get install mpi-default-dev

- CBLAS option: 
  The CBLAS library depends on BLAS. Therefore, when providing the include directory and the 
  library for CBLAS, you must also provide the BLAS library used for CBLAS. Press [t] to 
  toggle advanced mode in the ccmake GUI. With a custom build from the netlib.org sources, 
  the entry for the CBLAS library could look like this:
      CBLAS_LIBRARY /usr/local/lib/libcblas.a;/usr/local/lib/libblas.a

- CLAPACK option:
  The CLAPACK library depends on CBLAS or BLAS. For example, you can build CLAPACK from netlib.org 
  sources based on an existing CBLAS installation, hereby using the f2c library and the CBLAS 
  wrapper library coming with CLAPACK. In the ccmake GUI, you must provide the CLAPACK includes 
  and library, and also the f2c and CBLAS wrapper libraries. It could look like this:
      CLAPACK_LIBRARIES /usr/local/lib/libclapack.a;/usr/local/lib/libcblaswr.a;/usr/local/lib/libf2c.a
  Also, you might need to provide a linker flag for the FORTRAN library to build the executables 
  (tests and examples), depending on the compiler you use. With GCC, this is:
      CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS -lgfortran

- HDF5 option:
  Make sure, that your HDF5 library is compiled with interface version 1.6. Other interfaces versions
  are not supported so far.


Documentation
=============

To create the documentation you need Doxygen. Installation can be done
by f.e.

  sudo apt-get install doxygen
  sudo apt-get install graphviz   // for the dot tool to create images

To create the documentation change into <HIFLOWDIR>/doc and type

  doxygen Doxyfile

The documentation files are located in <HIFLOWDIR>/doc/doxygen/html and you might
open the index.html or hierarchy.html files for example.
