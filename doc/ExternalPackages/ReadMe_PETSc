PETSc should be installed in the following way:

Type inside the PETSC base folder: 

CONFIGURE:
$: ./configure --prefix=<path to PETSC install destination> --with-shared-libraries=1 --with-cc=<path to MPI compiler directory >/mpicc \
	--with-fc=<path to MPI compiler directory >/mpif90 --with-cxx=<path to MPI compiler directory >/mpicxx --with-mpiexec=<path to MPI compiler directory >/mpiexec \
	--download-scalapack --download-fblaslapack --download-suitesparse --download-mumps --with-parmetis-include=<path to parmetis base directory>/include \
	with-parmetis-lib="-L<path to parmetis library directory> -lparmetis -lmetis" --with-metis-include=<path to metis base directory>/metis-5.1.0/include \
	with-metis-lib="-L<path to parmetis library directory> -lmetis -lmetis"

with correct paths:
	<path to MPI compiler directory >
  	<path to PETSC install destination>
	<path to parmetis base directory>
	<path to metis base directory>
	<path to parmetis library directory>
	<path to metis library directory>

Alternatively: Use --with-mpi-dir=<path to mpi directory, e.g. /usr/lib/openmpi> instead of --with-cc=, --with-fc=, etc 

This command will configure PETSc in DEBUG mode and will download:
	fblaslapack
	Mumps
	Umfpack
	scalapack

Additional packages und interfaces can be obtained by 
	--download-<package name>

To compile PETSc in RELEASE mode, add the options 
	--with-debugging=0 COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' CXXOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' FOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 

To compile PETSc with complex numbers add the option --with-scalar-type=complex. In this case, the option PETSC_COMPLEX=ON hast to be set in ccmake.
CAUTION: The PETSc interface of Hiflow is currently not capable of dealing with complex PETSc, therefore, it is switched off and the PETSc Linear Algebra can't be used. 
However, the eigenvalue solver routines based on SLEpc can deal with complex PETSc, since they directly use the PETSc API instead of the Hiflow interface.
Actually, complex PETSc is mandatory for non-symmetric eigenvalue problems.


MAKE: 
$: make

INSTALL:
$: make install

TEST:
$: make test


To configure HiFlow, use

PETSC_DIR = <path to PETSC installation destination>
PETSC_INCLUDE_DIR = <path to PETSC installation destination>/include
PETSC_LIBRARY = <path to PETSC installation destination>/lib/libpetsc.so

To run an application using PETSc, add the following line to ~/.bashrc

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to PETSC install directory>/lib/

and run 
> source ~/.bashrc
